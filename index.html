      <h1>Greenhouse Gas Emissions · From Global View to Asian Subregions</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        When exploring the data on how industries and regions contribute to global greenhouse gas (GHG)
        emissions from 2010 to 2023, one pattern stood out to us immediately: Asia leads all continents
        across every major gas type.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        This was a consistent trend that appeared across our dataset, so we decided to dig deeper and use
        two external sources for context. The two articles we found — the United Nations Economic and Social
        Commission for Asia and the Pacific’s 2024 climate review and the “Emerging Carbon Dioxide Hotspots
        in East Asia” Nature article — helped us better understand why Asia shows such high emission levels
        and how our visual findings match broader research.

      <!-- 1st PARAGRAPH EXPLANATION -->
      <p class="note">
        Our first graph gives a global snapshot of how emissions differ across continents.
        The format highlights how Asia’s proportional difference across regions is not just limited to
        carbon dioxide (CO₂); it also extends across methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases.
        This aligns with the UN ESCAP 2024 review, which estimates that Asia/Pacific alone accounts for
        nearly 60% of global emissions in recent years. The article attributes this to rapid
        industrialization, large population growth, and heavy reliance on energy-intensive sectors.

      <!-- 2nd PARAGRAPH EXPLANATION -->
      <p class="note">
        Once we noticed Asia’s global lead, we zoomed in using a stacked bar chart to break emissions
        down by Asian subregions. This layered breakdown makes it easier to compare industries like
        electricity and heat generation, manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, and construction
        across Eastern, Southern, Western, and Southeastern Asia.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The graph shows that Eastern Asia has a very large emission contribution from electricity and
        manufacturing, while other regions show more influence from agriculture or transportation.
        In the Nature study on East Asian carbon hotspots, the authors show that China (in Eastern Asia)
        produces the majority of industrial and energy-related emissions, which matches what we see
        in our visualization.

      <p class="note">
        The third visualization brings everything together by highlighting where the most intense
        emission hotspots occur, displaying both industry and subregions simultaneously. The heatmap
        makes it easy to identify these “hotspots” because the highest-emitting combinations visually
        stand out through darker colors.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        As we suspected, Eastern Asia’s electricity/energy and manufacturing sectors light up as the
        most intense hotspots, directly reflecting the pattern in the Nature CO₂ hotspot study.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="header">
        <h2>Conclusions and Next Steps</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="note">
        Together, these three visualizations show a clear narrative: Asia dominates global greenhouse
        gas emissions, and within Asia, certain industries and subregions are responsible for the
        majority of output.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This raises important questions for climate policy, especially around how industrial transitions
        should be supported and how responsibility should be shared across regions. One could also say
        that it highlights inequality in both emissions and climate impacts.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        As a next step, it would be interesting to map emissions at a more granular geographic level
        or to visualize projections to see how these hotspots might change in the future.
